## ❓ What is "Modinator?"

*Modinator* is a Discord Bot built with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) v13 to help you and your server with all of your moderation needs.

## ❓ Why Modinator over other bots?

There are many reasons that you should choose modinator over other bots, one of them being that the LITE version *(this version)* is **open-source** with a developer that is checking for pull requests everyday. Thus meaning that the bot is not just a "get-what-you-get" kind of deal, the community actually get's to give feedback & maybe even help with the code!</br>
Isn't that awesome 😱

## 🧾 Commands

Since this is only the light version, there are not as many commands as there are in the pro version (coming soon).

However, this bot will still cover all moderation needs with commands such as

- `/ban`
- `/kick`
- `/mute`
- `/unmute`
- `/user-info`

And a help command!
