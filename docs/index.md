*This is the official page for everything relating to the Discord Bot "Modinator" from documentation to some information about the bot.*

## What is Modinator

Modinator is a Discord Bot that offers a plethora of moderation commands using the new Discord "interaction" technology to make the life of a Discord moderator just a little bit easier.

Modinator was developed from the ground up by Devin Conway.

## What makes it different from the other bots?

There are a lot of things that make this bot different from the others. The main one being though is that the main purpose of this bot is for moderation purposes, and nothing more, and nothing less. Unless you buy an addon of course.

Along with that, the core functions (kicking, banning, etc.) are offered for free and are even open source. You can find more information **[here](http://modinatorbot.tk/lite)**

While there are many other things to point out about the bot, these are the main things that make Modinator stand out.

## About the developer

**Hey there!**

My name is Devin Conway and I am a young, teenage developer that has been programming for about 4 years now.

I started out learning HTML & CSS, however over time I decided to move on from that *(although I do still dabble around in it)* and started making Discord bots about 2 years ago.
From there, I have done custom bots for a lot of people, but nothing as public as this.

Other than all of that. I'm just your normal, everyday teen that goes to school, has a girlfriend and all of that cool-fun-boring stuff.
