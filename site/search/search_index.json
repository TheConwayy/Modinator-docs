What is Modinator Modinator is a Discord Bot that offers a plethora of moderation commands using the new Discord \"interaction\" technology to make the life of a Discord moderator just a little bit easier. Modinator was developed from the ground up by Devin Conway. What makes it different from the other bots? There are a lot of things that make this bot different from the others. The main one being though is that the main purpose of this bot is for moderation purposes, and nothing more, and nothing less. Unless you buy an addon of course. Along with that, the core functions (kicking, banning, etc.) are offered for free and are even open source. You can find more information here While there are many other things to point out about the bot, these are the main things that make Modinator stand out. About the developer Hey there! My name is Devin Conway and I am a young, teenage developer that has been programming for about 4 years now. I started out learning HTML & CSS, however over time I decided to move on from that (although I do still dabble around in it) and started making Discord bots about 2 years ago. From there, I have done custom bots for a lot of people, but nothing as public as this. Other than all of that. I'm just your normal, everyday teen that goes to school, has a girlfriend and all of that cool-fun-boring stuff. Where to get Modinator If you are looking to purchase Modinator, just join this Discord and create a purchase ticket! If you do not want to click the link above, the invite link is: Getting Started Already purchased the bot? AWESOME!

Pre-requisites Please keep in mind that this bot is self hosted. It is highly recommended you buy a VPS or something alike to host the bot To host this bot, you will have to have the following on your PC and/or hosting service: NodeJS v16 + ( Download Link ) Some sort of text editor such as VSCode or Notepad++ You will also need the following NPM packages: TypeScript @ latest Discord.JS @ v13 + file-system (fs) @ latest js-yaml @ latest WOKCommands @ latest yaml @ latest There is a tutorial on how to download all of this below Installation To install Modinator and all of the packages it requires to run, please follow the steps below. Step 1 - Setup There is some setup that is involved with the bot. First, you are going to unzip the .zip file that was given to you upon purchase. - Suggestion Something such as \"7zip\" would be recommended for ease of use. However it is not required After the file is un-zipped, you should have a folder named \"Modinator\" that has files like this: \ud83d\udcc1 commands \ud83d\udcc1 help (this will have files in it) \ud83d\udcc1 moderation (this will have files in it) \ud83d\udcc1 util (this will have files in it) \ud83d\udcc1 config \ud83e\uddfe config.yml \ud83e\uddfe token.yml \ud83e\uddfe index.ts \ud83e\uddfe package.json We will now move onto installing packages Step 2 - Installing Packages First, you will want to open up you command prompt. To do this you will want to hold WIN+R . This will open up a little box in the bottom left of your screen. In there you will want to type cmd - Screenshot for reference You should then see your command prompt open up - Screenshot for reference When you see this, you will want to copy and paste this command into the command prompt. cd <path to folder with the \"index.ts\" file> - Useful Tip You can just copy the path at the top of the file explorer. Now you will want to copy the following commands into the command prompt. npm install -g typescript@latest npm install discord.js@13.6.0 npm install fs npm install yaml npm install wokcommands@latest npm install js-yaml - Each line is a separate command Step 3 - Getting your token To get you token to run the bot, you will need to head to this (https:/discord.com/developers) website. From there, you will want to click on the blue \"New Application\" button. - Screenshot for reference You will then be greeted by a prompt that says \"CREATE AN APPLICATION\" with an input for the name of the application. This will be the name of the bot . Once you have entered a name, click the next \"Create\" button. You will then be greeted by the application management page (that is not the official name just what I like to call it) If you would like to add an \"about me\" to the bot, you can do so by writing it in the \"Description\" box - Screenshot for reference From there, you will want to click the button that says \"Bot\" on the left side-bar. Then you will want to click on \"Add Bot\" - Screenshot for reference This will then bring you to the bot management page. Here, you can change the icon and name of the bot if you so desire. This is also the place where you will be setting up intents. - Screenshot for reference Then from there, you are going to click on the \"Copy\" button that is right below the \"Click to Reveal Token\" link. You are then going to open your token.yml file - It should be in this directory \ud83d\udcc1 config \ud83e\uddfe token.yml You are then going to paste the token right after the token: - Screenshot for reference Then you are done!
